Since we are not focusing on styling in this course, we are going to let CSS Frameworks handle the styling.

Remember we leared about having seperate files called stylesheets to store our styling? Lots of Amazing Developers have developed really cool styles sheets and open sourced them so that we can use them and make our projects look awesome. Including CSS Frameworks is really simple and can be done with just one line of code.

In this course we will be using the css framework Tailwind. Tailwind is an amazing open sourced CSS framework that makes everything look good ( well, almost everything! ).

> Before continuing, Tailwind and the use of css is not a requirement for this course, However it is highly recommended that you learn tailwind or any other CSS Framework if you want to work with web development

### Adding Tailwind

Using this version of Tailwind severely limits its features, but for the sake of this course we will be using this version. for the style nerds out there, visit this [link](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set it up yourself.

### Getting started with Tailwind
