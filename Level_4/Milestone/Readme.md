Our current tasks application can add tasks, view them and delete any given task.

To complete this level's milestone, you have to create a new page to view completed tasks and provide an option to complete a given task.

The spec for the new pages are given below, ensure that your solution matches the spec. Run the test suite to check if the functionality is working as expected

`GET /completed_tasks` Should render an html page with all the completed Tasks
`GET /completed_tasks/<task index>` should complete the task with the given index

All the other functionality should be exactly like in the demonstration video.

Upload your solution to a public github repository and submit the link to the repository to complete this milestone.
