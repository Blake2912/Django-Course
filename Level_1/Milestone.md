## Milestones

To complete this milestone you must create a fork of the repository provided and create a new folder with your GitHub username and add the solution to fizzbuzz in any programming language.

Fizzbuzz is a very simple program that prints numbers one by one till a given limit, But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

so if the limit is 5 the output will be the following

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
```

Fizzbzz can be solved in a lot of different ways, you can choose to do it the naive way, the extremely [over engineered way](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/tree/uinverse), or maybe something in between, figure out the most creative way you can solve this problem and a short comment on why you love your solution.

You can create a PR into this repo: https://github.com/coronasafe/fizzbuzz

> You can check out other solutions for inspiration

once you have created the pull request mark this activity as completed.
