In this video we will look at various ways we can run python

The first way to run python is to use the python shell, it can be invoked by directly typing python in the command line. and then you can type in the commands you want to run. This is possible because python is an interpreted language.

The second way is to create files and run them.

The third way is to use the debugger that vs code provides, this makes life easier and lets you focus on the code you are working on.
