The milestone for this level is to create a simple task management tool for the command line.

Our aim is to create a command-line tool that lets us add tasks, mark them as complete, and view pending/incomplete tasks.

You will be given an incomplete python class, your task is to modify the class and complete the functionality, Once you are done with the functionality, push the code into a GitHub repository and submit the repo URL.

You can find the incomplete code and the instructions to complete it in the following GitHub repository. ( Fork this repo to get started )
