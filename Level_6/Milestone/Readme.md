Our current tasks application can add tasks, view them and delete any given task.

You have to create another field to store the priority of a task, no two tasks can have the same priority, approriate form validations should also be present, the listing views must always be sorted by priority.

To understand how querysets can be ordered take a look [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#order-by) , you can use the exists method to check if an object already exists in the database, the exists method is documented [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.exists)

The spec for the new pages are given below, ensure that your solution matches the spec. Run the test suite to check if the functionality is working as expected

<Spec/Test Suite to be added after milestone approval>

> Make sure that you do not change the name of the models and the routes. This is to ensure that the tests are working as expected.

Upload your solution to a public github repository and submit the link to the repository to complete this milestone.
