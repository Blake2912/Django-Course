Unit Testing is one of the ways we can ensure that our application continues to work as intended over time as we introduce changes.
It keeps our application in a stable state and ensures that we don't break any of the functionality. It is a very important part of the development process.

Unit testing can also save time by cutting down on manual testing and quickly find bugs.

```
python manage.py test
```
