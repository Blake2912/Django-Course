Our current tasks application has APIs to add tasks, view them and delete any given task.

now let's try to store the history of a task! Create a new model that tracks the changes of every task ( status changes only ). This model should have a read-only API that, given a task should list all the changes made to that task along with when the change was made.

<Spec/Test Suite to be added after milestone approval>

< If this seems a bit hard, we can create something simpler like comments for a task ( as a separate model ) >

> Make sure that you do not change the name of the models and the routes. This is to ensure that the tests are working as expected.

Upload your solution to a public Github repository and submit the link to the repository to complete this milestone.
