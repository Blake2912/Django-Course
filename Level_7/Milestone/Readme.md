Our current tasks application has api's to add tasks, view them and delete any given task.

now lets try to store the history of a task! Create a new model that tracks the changes of every task ( status changes only ). This model should have a read only api that, given a task should list all the changed made to that task along with when the change was made.

<Spec/Test Suite to be added after milestone approval>

< If this seems a bit hard, we can create something simpler like comments for a task ( as a seperate model ) >

> Make sure that you do not change the name of the models and the routes. This is to ensure that the tests are working as expected.

Upload your solution to a public github repository and submit the link to the repository to complete this milestone.
